## Component Architecture Organization Decision

**Date**: 2025-04-01 23:30:00

**Decision**: Organized React components into dedicated subdirectories within `src/components/`:
- `game/`: Core gameplay components (GameBoard)
- `ui/`: General UI components (Controls, TokenPalette)
- `tokens/`: Token-related components (existing, unchanged)

**Rationale**: 
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Separates concerns between game logic and UI elements
- Creates clear component categories for future development

**Implementation Details**:
- Moved GameBoard.tsx to game/
- Moved Controls.tsx and TokenPalette.tsx to ui/
- Created basic test structure for all components
- Maintained existing tokens/ directory structure
