# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

## Component Architecture Organization Decision

**Date**: 2025-04-01 23:30:00

**Decision**: Organized React components into dedicated subdirectories within `src/components/`:
- `game/`: Core gameplay components (GameBoard)
- `ui/`: General UI components (Controls, TokenPalette)
- `tokens/`: Token-related components (existing, unchanged)

**Rationale**: 
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Separates concerns between game logic and UI elements
- Creates clear component categories for future development

**Implementation Details**:
- Moved GameBoard.tsx to game/
- Moved Controls.tsx and TokenPalette.tsx to ui/
- Created basic test structure for all components
- Maintained existing tokens/ directory structure

## State Management Implementation Decision

**Date**: 2025-04-02 00:10:00

**Decision**: Implemented React Context API for state management with two separate contexts:
- `GameContext`: Manages core game state (level, score, etc.)
- `SettingsContext`: Handles user preferences (theme, sound, etc.)

**Rationale**:
- Built-in React solution, avoiding unnecessary external dependencies
- Appropriate complexity level for current application needs
- Separates concerns between game state and user preferences
- Easy to maintain and extend as the application grows
- Simple integration with existing component architecture

**Implementation Details**:
- Created separate context files in `src/contexts/`
- Implemented provider components with initial state
- Set up TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Added comprehensive test coverage

## Token System Implementation Architecture

**Date**: 2025-04-02 13:13:32

**Decision**: Implemented token system using separate class-based components:
- Base token types and interfaces in src/types/tokens.ts
- Individual token implementations (LaserToken, MirrorToken, TargetToken)
- Centralized token exports through index.ts

**Rationale**: 
- Clear separation of concerns between token types
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript interfaces
- Modular design allows easy addition of new token types
- Centralized exports simplify token usage across components

**Implementation Details**:
- Created base token interfaces in types/tokens.ts
- Implemented individual token classes with specific behaviors
- Set up comprehensive test infrastructure for token components
- Used index.ts as a facade for token exports

- Integrated providers into App component hierarchy
