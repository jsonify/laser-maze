# Grid System Implementation Notes

## Component Architecture
- **GridCell**: Atomic component for individual cell rendering
  - Handles token display and basic interactions
  - Memoized for performance optimization
- **GameBoard**: Composite component
  - Manages 5x5 grid layout
  - Connects to GameContext for state management

## State Management
- **GameContext** provides:
  - Grid state management
  - Token placement/removal/rotation actions
  - Immutable state updates using map/filter

## Performance
- React.memo used on GridCell
- Callback functions memoized with useCallback
- Efficient grid rendering through keyed list items

## Testing Strategy
- 100% test coverage for GridCell component
- Integration tests for GameBoard-GameContext interaction
- Vitest + Testing Library for DOM testing

## Patterns & Standards
- Followed Atomic Design principles
- Strict TypeScript type safety
- ESLint rules enforced
- Documentation headers added to all new files
