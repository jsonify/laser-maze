# Component Architecture Setup - 2025-04-01

## Overview
Established the initial component architecture for the Laser Maze game as per the MVP plan. This involved:

- Verifying and updating the root `App` component and its test.
- Creating `game` and `ui` subdirectories within `src/components`.
- Moving existing components (`GameBoard`, `Controls`, `TokenPalette`) and creating placeholder tests in the new structure.

## Component Structure
- `src/components/app.tsx`: Root application component.
- `src/components/game/`: Contains core gameplay components.
    - `GameBoard.tsx`: Placeholder for the game board component.
- `src/components/ui/`: Contains general UI components.
    - `Controls.tsx`: Placeholder for game controls.
    - `TokenPalette.tsx`: Placeholder for the token palette.
- `src/components/tokens/`: (Existing) Contains token-related components (not modified in this task).

## Testing
- Basic placeholder tests created for `GameBoard`, `Controls`, and `TokenPalette` to ensure minimal rendering and test setup is functional.
- Addressed initial test failures by updating component implementations to render placeholders as expected by the tests.

## Next Steps
- Implement actual logic and UI for `GameBoard`, `Controls`, and `TokenPalette` components in subsequent tasks.
- Further refine component structure as needed during development.
